## A Review of a Few Online Markdown Editors

Welcome back! In my last post I discussed workflows for maintaining a blog powered by GitHub Pages + Jekyll. That's a popular stack for tech bloggers, but pretty bare-bones when it comes to actually drafting blog posts. For a better writing experience I'm trying out a few markdown editors.

Markdown editors make blogging much easier. You can focus much more on content and less on technical details like formatting your page, making git commits, managing drafts and published files, etc. 

My ideal writing environment would be a Google Docs plug-in where I could draft a document in Docs and have it be saved automatically (as a markdown file) to my GitHub repo. And where I could add math forumulas as LaTeX.

That said, here are some features I'm looking for
- Draft caching: Will I lose my work if I refresh the browser while drafting a new document?
- Mobile friendliness: Is there an app? A responsive website?
- Offline mode
- Integrations with Google Drive and GitHub
- LaTeX editing: a formula builder or editor to assist with LaTeX syntax
- Text blocks formatted for code, quotes, etc

#### Project Gabriel

A quick note: there actually is a Google Docs extension for publishing content to GitHub Pages, but it's abandonware. The plug-in, [Gabriel](https://educ.io/extensions/gabriel), claims to convert docs to markdown and commit them to a Pages repo, but the source code is unchanged since 2015 (see [GitHub project](https://github.com/thiscouldbejd/Gabriel)) and the product gets unenthusiastic reviews on the Chrome Store ([3 stars, 28 reviews](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gabriel/okimajjeocnndpifeelaajdebkkbckff)).

#### Prose.io

**3.5 / 5** This oft-mentioned editor is solid but rather spartan. The interface is similar to editing markdown on github.com but with a nicer editor and more syncing options. (Actually, it might use the exact same editor, [atom](atom.io).)

The good
- Clean interface

The bad
- No keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Cmd + K for links)
- No instant preview
- Weird markdown editing behavior
  - E.g, clicking a header format doesn't change the format of the current line; it creates a new paragraph, breaking the text at wherever your cursor was. 

The ugly
- The text editor only takes up 2/3 of the screen (..?)
- Can't move files to different folders (!!)
