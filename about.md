Hi! I'm William. I'm a machine learning engineer by profession, and my interests include machine learning, politics, art, technology, language, economics and various other topics. 

I studied physics, literature and economics at Duke University, graduating in 2012. After that I went into consumer banking analytics at Capital One (2013 - 2016). I then went into academia and joined a research lab at HHMI Janelia where I worked on deep learning (CNNs) applied to neuroscience and connectomics (2016 - 2017). Since then I've been consulting in data science on a contract basis. I'm based in Orlando, FL, but travel quite a bit to explore and learn about new places, visit friends, attend conferences, etc.
