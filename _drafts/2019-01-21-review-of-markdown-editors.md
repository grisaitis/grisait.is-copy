## Online Markdown Editors and GitHub Pages

Using a markdown editor is a great way to draft and publish blog posts for a Jekyll + GitHub Pages site. I'm not fluent in markdown syntax -- the language for formatting text in these documents, with headers, sections, and so on -- and neither do I want to be. And beyond markdown I want to avoid technical details like formatting pages, making git commits, managing folders with drafts, etc. 

That said, what's the best editor? Is there one out there that actually works well? And what features should it have to be most useful for a Pages blog? My ideal editor would be something like Google Docs with two additions: (1) the ability to sync with GitHub and (2) a LaTeX editor for math expressions. Does something like this exist?

I haven't found anything that checks all my boxes, but I've tried a few. The most popular free editors, after to some googling, seem to be prose.io, stackedit.io, and dillinger.io. (Please comment below if you think I'm missing a big one.)

Here's what I'm looking for in an editor:
- Offline support
- A mobile app, or a good mobile browser design
- Integrations with Google Docs and GitHub
	- I'd like to edit articles via Google Docs, especially if offline and mobile support is scant.
- Caching drafts
	- When I refresh the page, I should not lose my work
- A LaTeX editor, formula builder, or something to help with LaTeX syntax

#### Gabriel: An Extension to Google Docs
My rating: **0 / 5**

Someone actually made a Google Docs plug-in for Pages... but I'm not sure it even works. The plug-in, called [Gabriel](https://educ.io/extensions/gabriel), converts docs to markdown and commits them to a Pages repo. But the project code is [unchanged since 2015](https://github.com/thiscouldbejd/Gabriel) and reviews are unenthusiastic on the Chrome Store ([3 stars, 28 reviews](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gabriel/okimajjeocnndpifeelaajdebkkbckff)). 


#### Prose.io

My rating: **3 / 5** 

Prose.io is a pretty good editor. It's a clean, minimalist app, which summarizes its best and worst aspects. The site is a breeze to use, with no clutter, but in practice prose.io feels incomplete and feature poor. It's basically like editing markdown on github.com, but with a nicer editor and more syncing options. (Actually, the editor might be the same... the [atom](atom.io) editor, open sourced by GitHub.)

A few more critiques...
- No keyboard shortcuts
- No instant preview
- The text editor only takes up 2/3 of the screen (why??)
- Can't move files, e.g. from `_drafts` to `_posts` to publish an article

### StackEdit

My rating: **4 / 5** 

This is the best editor I've tried so far, but it still leaves some things to be desired for this picky writer. 

The interface strikes a great balance between simplicity and making as many options visible to you for editing. The app is divided in two: the left side is for writing in markdown, and the right side renders the result instantly. Neither side feels cramped. StackEdit also sports most keyboard shortcuts, like tab for indentation. 

On the downside, it feels old (circa 2014?) and has no mobile app. And should a text editor - in 2019 - really get credit for implementing tab indentation?

### Closing thoughts

There are plenty of markdown editors out there, but I don't expect to do all my writing in one. **Google Docs is the best text editor.** No markdown editor will surpass it in terms of interface, mobile support, offline editing, collaboration, and all the other features that make it indispensable. Put another way, a nice editor i
