title: Setting up Jekyll!
---

After a year of using Squarespace I've decided to migrate to Jekyll with GitHub pages. And the main thing I've learned is: use the platform most people like you use. 

Perhaps there are few topics more mundane and overdone than talking about blog platforms... But I'll reflect briefly on how I got here. 

I'm very happy to be on a simple, developer-friendly platform like Jekyll on GitHub pages. Squarespace is a wonderful service, but is overkill for me and not really designed for me anyway. I chose it because of the beautiful themes; perhaps I am vain, but I don't want an ugly blog! The reality is, though, that Squarespace is more optimized for photo-heavy sites and e-commerce. 

At the time I was considering Jekyll, Ghost, and Squarespace. With Jekyll and Ghost I was underwhelmed by the themes. Did someone code these up in 20 minutes for a high school project? Squarespace by comparison looked sublimely inspired, designed by a happy, thoughtful person who know what they were doing. 

Well, it turns out Squarespace was too clunky for me anyway! Yes, more beautiful, but too complicated. Also, as a developer, I felt rather silly dragging boxes around in a WYSIWYG editor. Yes, Squarespace solved lots of problems related to deployment and hosting, but actually felt more burdensome to set up and draft posts. 

To close out I'll list some things I need to figure out with setting up Jekyll & GitHub pages. Perhaps I'll blog about this later. ;)
* How do I write math expressions in LaTeX and have them show up nicely in Jekyll posts? [This post by Ian Goodfellow](http://www.iangoodfellow.com/blog/jekyll/markdown/tex/2016/11/07/latex-in-markdown.html) (inventor of GANs, right?) gives me some optimism. 
* How do I use my custom domain name?
* How do I set up an about page, some static pages, and a blog separately?
* How do I integrate disqus for comments on blog posts?
